Train agents to tailor communications and only include relevant advisories based on the specific itinerary.; Utilized cross sell & up sell opportunity (Hotel, Car, Insurance): Train agents to look for cross-selling opportunities, especially early in the interaction before the scope is narrowed. For example, after the initial request, the agent could have asked if the client also needs help with accommodation or ground transport arrangements before proceeding with flight options. However, they should also listen for cues that the client has a limited need and not push for additional services if clearly not required."
