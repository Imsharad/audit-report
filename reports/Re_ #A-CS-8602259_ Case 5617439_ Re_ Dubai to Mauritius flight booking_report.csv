If the client did not respond with these details in a timely manner, the agent should have followed up to request the information again prior to ticketing.; Utilized cross sell & up sell opportunity (Hotel, Car, Insurance): The agent should look for natural openings to politely inquire about the client's hotel, ground transport or insurance needs when booking international travel. A soft, open-ended question could uncover additional service opportunities without being pushy. When an add-on like a limo booking is offered, it must be properly executed."
